# 15x15 Choc Keycap
## What is this?
There's a dire lack of FDM printable Kailh Choc keycaps that work on mininum spaced boards, such as the minimally spaced version of [@kilipan](https://github.com/kilipan)'s excellent [Zilpzalp](https://github.com/kilipan/zilpzalp/tree/main). I wanted to fill this keycap void, and also design a keycap for my keychain macropad.

## 3D Printing Instructions
You can print this on any FDM printer with a 0.4 (or smaller) nozzle, with the lowest layer height your printer and nozzle can go to. The settings I used are are follows:
- 0.08 layer height
- 0.44 line width (110% of nozzle)
- 100% infill
- Oriented on one of the outer edges of the keycap
- Brim and supports are enabled
## Inspirations
I was heavily inspired by the "wrk." keycaps, designed and sold by [WORK LOUDER](https://worklouder.cc/shop/wrk-blind/). In addition, @koozie's (Please let me know if you have a GitHub!) [Choc Louder](https://www.printables.com/model/1066117-choc-louder-keycaps-choc-and-mx-spacing) keycaps showed to me that a keycap in that style can be FDM printed sucessfully.
